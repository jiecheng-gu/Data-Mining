# Data Mining Project - Exploring Public Opinions of Remote Study during COVID-19 Pandemic

## Introduction
In this project, we use data from social media Twitter and Weibo — a Chinese Twitter-like platform — to further examine people’s attitudes towards online learning during the covid-19 pandemic. We ﬁrst examine the correlation between user features and their opinions, and then try to analyze the reasons behind these opinions and suggest ways to improve the eﬃciency of online learning so that it can be more popular and more adaptable. Because generalized online learning can bring many beneﬁts to our society as well as individuals once it becomes part of everyone’s daily life. For example, adapting online learning can lead to a fair distribution of educational resources in rural areas. Besides, as the volume of information grows exponentially, it is necessary for people to keep learning in order to maintain their ability to think independently. Additionally, generalized online learning also brings the chance to develop a personal education plan for everyone, in which students can truly discover their interests and take advantage of them. If remote study is adapted as a normal form in public education, students can have the chance to practice how to arrange their time, which is an important skill in future life.

## Conclusions
There are significant differences in the sentiment scores distributions between Weibo and Twitter. The primary attitude among Twitter users is positive, but the main attitude from Weibo users is negative. We believe that one of the reasons is that the United States has a longer history of online learning than China, and people get used to it. Platforms such as Udemy and Duolingo emerged in 2010, and Coursera started to provide the opportunity for students to finish bachelor’s and master’s degrees online ever since 2012. Last year, Edge Pathways was established in New York, which cooperates with enterprises to provide internships and study opportunities to high students who are interested in STEM courses. Edge Pathways aims to replace the traditional lecture-style college education. Education technology companies develop quickly with innovations in the United States in recent decades.
